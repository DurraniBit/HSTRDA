# HSTRDA for motor imagery EEG classification
### HSTRDA:  Hybrid Spatio-temporal Riemannian Domain Adaptation Scheme for Improved Motor Imagery Classification
core idea: CNN (an improved version of EEGNet) + Transformer encoder 

Our research builds upon and improves the [EEG Conformer](https://github.com/eeyhsong/EEG-Conformer) and [RGN](https://github.com/shiroger/Riemannian-Geometry-Networks), and we sincerely thank the creators of these open-source project.
